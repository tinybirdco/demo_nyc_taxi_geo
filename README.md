# Use Case Demo: NYC Taxi Geospatial Analytics

This repository contains code for an example geospatial analytics project using the publicly available [NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elemento/nyc-yellow-taxi-trip-data?resource=download&select=yellow_tripdata_2016-03.csv).

The application is a map of the greater NY area with NYC taxi pickups and dropoffs plotted using H3 indexing. The color intensity of the hexagons indicates the number of rides in that area (i.e. the density).
